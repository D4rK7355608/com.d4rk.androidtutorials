The packages you download have libraries, which helps you in creating your app.\n\nThis is an overview of all Android versions and their corresponding identifiers for Android developers. Anyone is welcome to open an issue or pull request. Happy developing!</string>
    <string name="summary_view_binding">View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.</string>
    <string name="summary_first_step">The first step to create a new project in Android Studio is to click on the <b>New project</b> button as shown in the image and continue to the next step.</string>
    <string name="summary_second_step">The second step is to select the activity type that suits your app. You can choose from some presets that can simplify your work. Select one of them and click on the <b>next</b> button.</string>
    <string name="summary_third_step">The third and final step is to configure your app settings, such as the app name, <b>package name</b>, preferred <b>programming language</b> and <b>minimum SDK</b>. You can learn more about them on <a href="https://developer.android.com/">Android Developers</a>.</string><string name="summary_enable_binding">View binding is enabled on a module by module basis. To enable view binding in a module, set the viewBinding build option to true in the module-level build.gradle file, as shown in the following example:</string>
    <string name="summary_browse_terms_of_service_and_privacy_policy">Read and agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to continue.</string>
    <string name="summary_shortcuts">Android Studio includes keyboard shortcuts for many common actions. Keep in mind, because Android Studio is based on IntelliJ IDEA, you can find additional shortcuts in the IntelliJ IDEA keymap reference documentation.</string>
    <string name="summary_toggle">You can add a basic toggle button to your layout with the ToggleButton object. Android 4.0 (API level 14) introduces another kind of toggle button called a switch that provides a slider control, which you can add with a Switch object. SwitchCompat is a version of the Switch widget which runs on devices back to API 7.</string>
    <string name="summary_clocks">Important Note: Digital clock is deprecated in version API 17. From API level 17 you can use TextClock instead of digital clock. Below is the description of Text clock in android.</string>
    <string name="summary_close">Are you sure you want to exit?</string>
    <string name="summary_buttons">Buttons are an essential element of any Android app. They allow users to interact with the app and perform actions such as submitting a form, starting a new activity, or making a purchase.\n\nIn Android Studio, buttons are created using the Button class and can be customized in a variety of ways, including setting their text, color, and size. They can also be configured to trigger different actions when clicked, such as starting a new activity or displaying a pop-up message.\n\nButtons can be placed anywhere in an app\'s layout and can be used in conjunction with other UI elements such as text fields and lists to create a fully functional and user-friendly app.\n\nOverall, buttons are a simple but powerful tool for building engaging and interactive Android apps.</string>
    <string name="summary_permissions">For instance, if your app needs to download something, it will require Internet permission.\n\nTake a look on Android Developers website for all permissions and a reference to the official documentation!\n\nAndroid apps must request permission to access certain features or data on a device. These permissions are used to protect the privacy of the user and the device. When an app is installed, the user is prompted to grant or deny the app the permissions it requests. The app will only have access to the features or data it requested permission for.\n\nThere are two types of permissions: normal and dangerous. Normal permissions do not pose a risk to the user\'s privacy. They include things like internet access and vibrate. Dangerous permissions, on the other hand, can potentially access sensitive information or actions and are therefore more restricted. These include permissions such as access to the user\'s location, camera, and contacts.\n\nIt\'s important for app developers to only request the permissions that are absolutely necessary for their app to function properly. This helps protect the user\'s privacy and also makes the app more user-friendly.</string>
    <string name="summary_image_buttons">Image buttons are buttons that contain an image instead of text. They can be used in Android to provide a more visually appealing and interactive user interface. Image buttons can be used to trigger actions, navigate to different screens, or display additional information. They are often used in combination with text labels to provide clear communication to the user about the button\'s purpose.</string>

    <string name="summary_image_view">AndroidX AppCompatImageView is a subclass of ImageView that is designed to support various features of the ActionBar and Material Design. It is part of the AndroidX library, which is a set of support libraries that offer backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs.\n\nAppCompatImageView is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for ImageView, allowing developers to use the same code and UI elements across different versions of Android. It includes support for various features such as tinting, loading vector drawables, and handling image scaling.\n\nAppCompatImageView also includes support for Material Design features such as elevation, which allows the image view to cast a shadow and appear to be raised above the surface of the layout. It also includes support for the Material Design ripple effect, which is a visual effect that is applied when the image view is touched.\n\nIn summary, AndroidX AppCompatImageView is a versatile and feature-rich subclass of ImageView that is designed to support a wide range of features and design elements in Android apps.</string>
