    <string name="summary_buttons">Buttons are an essential element of any Android app. They allow users to interact with the app and perform actions such as submitting a form, starting a new activity, or making a purchase.\n\nIn Android Studio, buttons are created using the Button class and can be customized in a variety of ways, including setting their text, color, and size. They can also be configured to trigger different actions when clicked, such as starting a new activity or displaying a pop-up message.\n\nButtons can be placed anywhere in an app\'s layout and can be used in conjunction with other UI elements such as text fields and lists to create a fully functional and user-friendly app.\n\nOverall, buttons are a simple but powerful tool for building engaging and interactive Android apps.</string>
    <string name="summary_permissions">For instance, if your app needs to download something, it will require Internet permission.\n\nTake a look on Android Developers website for all permissions and a reference to the official documentation!\n\nAndroid apps must request permission to access certain features or data on a device. These permissions are used to protect the privacy of the user and the device. When an app is installed, the user is prompted to grant or deny the app the permissions it requests. The app will only have access to the features or data it requested permission for.\n\nThere are two types of permissions: normal and dangerous. Normal permissions do not pose a risk to the user\'s privacy. They include things like internet access and vibrate. Dangerous permissions, on the other hand, can potentially access sensitive information or actions and are therefore more restricted. These include permissions such as access to the user\'s location, camera, and contacts.\n\nIt\'s important for app developers to only request the permissions that are absolutely necessary for their app to function properly. This helps protect the user\'s privacy and also makes the app more user-friendly.</string>
    <string name="summary_image_buttons">Image buttons are buttons that contain an image instead of text. They can be used in Android to provide a more visually appealing and interactive user interface. Image buttons can be used to trigger actions, navigate to different screens, or display additional information. They are often used in combination with text labels to provide clear communication to the user about the button\'s purpose.</string>

    <string name="summary_image_view">AndroidX AppCompatImageView is a subclass of ImageView that is designed to support various features of the ActionBar and Material Design. It is part of the AndroidX library, which is a set of support libraries that offer backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs.\n\nAppCompatImageView is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for ImageView, allowing developers to use the same code and UI elements across different versions of Android. It includes support for various features such as tinting, loading vector drawables, and handling image scaling.\n\nAppCompatImageView also includes support for Material Design features such as elevation, which allows the image view to cast a shadow and appear to be raised above the surface of the layout. It also includes support for the Material Design ripple effect, which is a visual effect that is applied when the image view is touched.\n\nIn summary, AndroidX AppCompatImageView is a versatile and feature-rich subclass of ImageView that is designed to support a wide range of features and design elements in Android apps.</string>
